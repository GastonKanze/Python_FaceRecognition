Testing the Python library face_recognition 

To use face_recognition you need to run in the terminal in your project folder:
    - Set up a virtual environment: pip install pipenv
    - Start the virtual environment: pipenv shell
    - pipenv install face_recognition

A description of the folders:
    - img/groups: Groups of people
    - img/known: You have images with the name of the person, with these images we match the images of the unknown folder.
    - img/unknown: Images of uknown people

Terminal commands:
face_recognition ./img/known ./img/unknown -> You can match the images (You see the names of the images)
face_recognition  --show-distance true ./img/known ./img/unknown -> the higher the value, the greater the similarity
face_recognition ./img/known ./img/unknown | cut -d ',' -f2 -> To show only the name
